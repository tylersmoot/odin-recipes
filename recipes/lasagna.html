<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 clove garlic</li>
    <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1 cup spaghetti sauce</li>
    <li>6 precooked or oven-ready lasagna noodles (each about 7x3 in.)</li>
    <li>1 container (12 ounces) reduces-fat cottage cheese (1 1/2 cups)</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (4 ounces)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>

    
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Peel and finely chop the garlic. Cook the beef and garlic in the skillet over medium heat about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the beef is brown; drain.</li>
    <li>Stir the Italian seasoning and spaghetti sauce into the beef. Spread 1/4 cup of the beef mixture in the ungreased square pan.</li>
    <li>Top with 2 noodles, placing them so they do not overlap or touch the sides of the pan because they will expand as they bake. Spread about 1/2 cup of the remaining beef mixture over the noodles.</li>
    <li>Spread about 1/2 cup of the cottage cheese over the beef mixture. Sprinkle with about 1/3 cup of the mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Repeat layering twice more, beginning the 2 more noodles and following directions in steps 3 and 4. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake 30 minutes. Carefully remove the foil, and continue baking about 10 minutes longer or until lasagna is bubbly arround the edges and looks very hot. Let stand 10 minutes, so the lasagna will become easier to cut and serve.</li>
    
</ul>
